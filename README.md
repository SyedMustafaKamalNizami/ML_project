Project Title: Customer Churn Detection
Introduction
This project focuses on the development and comparative evaluation of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications domain using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The dataset contains a combination of numerical and categorical customer attributes, including demographic information, service usage patterns, contract details, and billing information. A robust data preprocessing pipeline was implemented to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding, ensuring compatibility across all models. Three predictive approaches were investigated: Logistic Regression as a baseline linear model, Random Forest as a non-linear ensemble method, and a deep learning–based Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) implemented in PyTorch and integrated with scikit-learn using the Skorch framework. The deep learning model incorporates multiple fully connected layers with ReLU activations, dropout-based regularization, and a class-weighted binary cross-entropy loss function to effectively address class imbalance. Hyperparameter optimization for all models was conducted using GridSearchCV with cross-validation, and model performance was assessed using F1 score and ROC-AUC metrics to account for the imbalanced nature of the churn prediction task. The project culminates in a comprehensive comparative analysis, identifying the most effective modeling approach and producing a deployable end-to-end prediction pipeline for real-world churn prediction applications.
